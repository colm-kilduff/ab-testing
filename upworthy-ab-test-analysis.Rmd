### Introduction

In this report, we will be analysing the [upworthy research archive](https://osf.io/jd64p/). The upworthy research archive is a dataset of thousands of A/B tests of headlines conducted by Upworthy from January 2013 to April 2015.

### Analysis

We load in the dataset and show a sample of the dataset below.

```{r read}
exploratory_data <-
  read_csv(glue('{getwd()}/datasets/upworthy-archive-exploratory-packages-03.12.2020.csv'), show_col_types = FALSE) 

exploratory_data <-
  exploratory_data |>
  rename(id = `...1`)

exploratory_data |>
  head(10)
```

We want to understand more about the dataset before we get into an analysis of the A/B test results.

```{r summaries}

exploratory_data |>
  summary()
```

```{r}

exploratory_data |>
  summarise(num_unique_ab_tests = n_distinct(clickability_test_id), num_winners = sum(winner))

```
